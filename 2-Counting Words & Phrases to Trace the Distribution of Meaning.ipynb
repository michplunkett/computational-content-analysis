    "# Week 2 - Counting Words & Phrases (Computational Linguistics)\n",
    "This week, we take text corpora that we have developed, spidered, scraped, and encoded, and we find and count words,\n",
    "simple and parsed phrases and explore the statistical properties of those counts (e.g., word frequency distributions). \n",
    "Initially, we model how to search corpora for keywords or phrases. Next, we examine the distributions of terms and \n",
    "phrases across a corpus, and the correlation between different words and phrase counts. In order to do this effectively,\n",
    "we coarsely disambiguate words based of part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and normalize them through stemming and \n",
    "lemmatization. Next we distinguish *important* words and phrase within the corpus, and image them with Wordls! \n",
    "Then we calculate word frequencies, conditional frequencies (the frequency of word *shock* conditional on the \n",
    "presence of word *awe*), and statistically significant collocations of lengths 2 through $n$. Finally, we calculate \n",
    "and visualize Differences (Divergences and Distances) between the word frequency distributions from two corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we shift to focus not simply on the *ideas* in a corpus, but also extracting precise *claims*. This process \n",
    "involves a sequential pipeline of classifying and structuring tokens from text, each of which generates potentially \n",
    "useful data for the content analyst. Steps in this process, which we examine in this notebook, include: 1) tagging \n",
    "words by their part of speech (POS) to reveal the linguistic role they play in the sentence (e.g., Verb, Noun, \n",
    "Adjective, etc.); 2) tagging words as named entities (NER) such as places or organizations; 3) structuring or \n",
    "\"parsing\" sentences into nested phrases that are local to, describe or depend on one another; and 4) extracting \n",
    "informational claims from those phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be introducing spaCy as a package for Computational Linguistics, and also walk you through how to use \n",
    "the Davies Corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we wish to avoid using NLTK for heavy corpus analysis, some of its smaller functions can still be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, for final projects that draw on these tools, we encourage you to install the software on your own \n",
    "machines or shared servers at the university (RCC, SSRC) in order to perform these operations on much more text.\n",

Next, we can remove some 'stop words', stem the remaining words to remove suffixes, prefixes and (in some languages) infixes, or lemmatize tokens by intelligently grouping inflected or variant forms of the same word (e.g., with a stemmer and a dictionary).\n",

    "KL and $\\chi^2$ divergences are members of the broader <a \"href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-divergence\" target=\"_blank\">$f$-divergence</a> family, a function of $D_f (P || Q)$ that calculates the difference between two probability distributions P and Q. The KL $f(t)$ is $ t \\text{ log } t $, while the $\\chi^2$ is $t^2-1$. KL comes from information and $\\chi^2$ from measure theory. As such, the KL divergence computes the relative entropy between two distributions--how they differ in bits, while the $\\chi^2$ whether the same statistical inferences can be drawn from them both.  \n",

Note that the KL divergence is in general not commutative, i.e. $D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(P\\|Q) \\neq D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(Q\\|P)$ .\n",

    "Now we will calculate the KL divergence for each pair of corpora, turn the results into a matrix, and visualize the matrix as a heatmap. Recall that $D_{\\mathrm{KL}}(P\\|Q)$ measures the amount of information loss when $Q$ is used to approximate $P$. Here, the rows are the $P$s used for calculating KL divergences, and the columns are the $Q$s. So, each cell measures the amount of information loss when the word distribution of the column text is used to approximate the word distribution of the row text. Because the KL divergence is directional, such that the divergence of $P$ from $Q$ is different from the same of $Q$ from $P$, the matrix is assymetric and contains unique information above and below the diagonal. The same is true for the $\\chi^2$ divergence."
